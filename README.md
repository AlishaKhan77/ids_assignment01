## Tools and Technologies Used
HTML5: Markup language for creating the structure of the web page.
CSS3: Stylesheet language for designing the layout and look of the page.
JavaScript: Basic JavaScript file to handle interactivity (optional).
Git: Version control system to manage the project's codebase.
GitHub: Remote repository for hosting and sharing the code.  

 ## Key Actions
  Throughout the development of this project, Git was used for version control. Here's a log of some key Git actions:

Initialized Git repository and added base files.
Added basic structure to the index.html file.
Implemented navigation bar and portfolio sections.
Styled the webpage using styles.css.
Added images to the assets folder and linked them to the project.


Working on this portfolio website provided me with valuable experience using Git and GitHub for version control. I created branches for new features, which allowed me to experiment without affecting the main codebase. One challenge I faced was merging branches when conflicts arose, but I was able to resolve them by carefully reviewing the conflicting code and ensuring both changes were integrated smoothly.

Overall, this project helped me better understand the importance of frequent commits and branching to manage a project efficiently. Using GitHub also gave me insight into collaborative development and how tracking progress with commit history can make debugging and feature development more manageable.
